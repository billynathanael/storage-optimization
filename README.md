In this project, I addressed a warehouse space constraint problem for an automotive Tier 1 supplier in China, where the warehouse could only store materials for 5 hours of production, falling short of the required 8 hours. By identifying inefficiencies in the pallet rack system, where pallets shorter than the 1.4-meter slot height wasted vertical space, I developed a Multi-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using the Gurobi optimizer. Formulated as a multiple knapsack problem, the model optimized pallet assignments to maximize material storage within height constraints. My work involved defining binary variables, setting height and assignment constraints, and implementing the solution in Python, aiming to meet the 8-hour production requirement without expanding the warehouse.
